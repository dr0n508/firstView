Please review this Agreement carefully as these terms form a binding agreement between you and First Student regarding your use of the FirstView™ Product.</p>
          <h3>Your Account</h3>

          <p>You agree not to access the FirstView™ Product using a method other than the interface and the instructions that First Student provides. You may use the FirstView™ Product only as permitted by law, and First Student may suspend or stop providing the FirstView™ Product to you if you do not comply with First Student’s terms or policies or if First Student is investigating suspected misconduct.</p>

          <p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF FIRST STUDENT, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, TO THE EXTENT THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DISCLAIMER OF THE SAME, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE FirstView™ Product.</p>
          <p>THE LIMITATIONS ON FIRST STUDENT’S LIABILITY TO YOU SET FORTH HEREIN WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT FIRST STUDENT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PARENT, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR THEIR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES.</p>

          <p>All of the Terms herein control the relationship between First Student and you with respect to the FirstView™ Product. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
